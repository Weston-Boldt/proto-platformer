PROTO-PLATFORMER
W-I-P (name not final)

i am in the first half of iteration 1 still

a note about what i mean about iterations
that is simply where i feel like the stages of development is going to be
none of this is set in stone and is entirely elastic, however i do need to have
a high level roadmap in order to keep track of what the heck to work on and prioritize
right now i have time to spend about 1 - 3 hours a night 4 nights a week on this game
so on inbetween days i can kind of forget what to hack on. maybe the readme is not a good
place for project management but i feel like at this time it might be manageable.

ITERATION 1 - still here
goals:
  get enough features added to extend into a bigger game
  this is less than a prototype, its more of a base to build the prototype on

ITERATION 2
goals:
  different enemies
  5 levels
  stub assets and finished assets
  beginning of polish

ITERATION 3
goals:
  polish
  
ITERATION 4
goals:
  -- if we are here i'm feeling like something must have gone horrible some where
  -- and we need to keep working so ideally the game is "shipped" before this point
  fix broken stuff
  polish more

features i've added
  jumping
  walking
  collisions
  entity spawning based on tiled
  trigger spawning based on tiled
  basic enemies
  
features in development
  attacks -- need to enter damage state, data is there though
  health system
  attack system
  enemy ai -- basic stuff is there right now ai logic exists in update methods


features to dev next
  animations -- need to create more assets to animate but currently have a simple idle for blue guy
  power up system
  level progression -- going to next room in a level, or next level itself
  bosses

issues
    - need some design work on what mechanics need to be done
    - need some time to figure out these state changes for damage
    - need an asset pipeline (not a huge issue right now)
