PROTO-PLATFORMER
W-I-P (name not final)

features i've added
  jumping
  walking
  collisions
  entity spawning based on tiled
  trigger spawning based on tiled
  
features in development
  enemies -- spawning but don't do anything yet
  sensors -- a way for entities other than the player to 'see' whats going on
          -- could be a decent way to handle basic ai patterns
          -- they are showing up but not doing anything
  triggers -- should be automatic or by pressing the `action button` when overlapped
           -- that works but the triggers themselves dont do anything

features to dev next
  animations -- need to create more assets to animate but currently have a simple idle for blue guy
  health system
  enemy ai
  attack system
  power up system
  level progression -- going to next room in a level, or next level itself
  bosses

issues
  - needs a code cleanup session soon
  - currently too much code lives in the player class
    such as gravity, what i'm imagining is that humps.Class
    doesnt support a lot of features you would expect from inheritance models
    so what could be done instead is adding little functions in the entity class
    that can help, although not every entity will be affected by gravity so its a bit of a 
    issue
  - assets are basically done whenever i feel like it and need to be put to a schedule
  - lots of code can be factored and rm
