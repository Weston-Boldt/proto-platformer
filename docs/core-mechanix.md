# Core Mechanics

## Player's Punch

Player has a punch button, when pressed the player can attempt to land an attack so hard that the
screen shakes!

if a player punches an enemy the player then can 'Aim' that enemy and it will launch towards another
enemy hopefully causing a chain reaction

if a player punches a wall, depending on what directional keys are pressed, the player will launch
himself in 1 of 8 directions, this could be used to set up a punch for an enemy
